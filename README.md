# Spotify Terraform

Using this project as an opportunity to further explore the world of Cloud Engineering and DevOps. Thus, the aims of this project are to develop my knowledge in the following areas:
- Deploy all components using IaC (Terraform) as opposed to using a visual console
- Package everything as Docker image
- Use 
- Doing everything via Linux
- Ansible for automation
- EFS
- VPCs and Subnets
- KMS for 
- CI/CD

The end goal is the ability to automatically create a Spotify playlist from a specified artist. Thanks to @conradludgate for creating this Spotify provider on Terraform.

The plan is to create a Docker image that includes Terraform and any necessary dependencies. The Docker container can then be used to execute Terraform commands.
