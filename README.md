# Spotify Terraform

Using this project as an opportunity to further explore the world of Cloud Engineering and DevOps. Thus, the aims of this project are to develop my knowledge in the following areas:
- IaC (Terraform)
- Virtualisation and Containerisation (Docker, Kubernetes, ECS)
- Linux
- Ansible
- EFS
- VPCs and Subnets
- CI/CD

The end goal is the ability to automatically create a Spotify playlist from a specified artist. Thanks to @conradludgate for providing this Spotify provider.
