# Spotify Terraform

Using this project as an opportunity to improve / fill any gaps in my Data Engineering knowledge. Thus, the aims of this project are to develop my knowledge in the following areas:
- IaC (Terraform)
- Virtualisation and Containerisation (Docker, Kubernetes, ECS)
- Linux
- Ansible
- EFS
- VPCs and Subnets

The end goal is the ability to automatically create a Spotify playlist from a specified artist. Thanks to @conradludgate for providing this Spotify provider.
